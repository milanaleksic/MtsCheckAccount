There are 2 3rd party libraries I am using in MtsCheckAccount.

1. ICE JNIRegistry 3.1.3
2. RXTX 2.2 (a snapshot dating from 2008)

Both of these are either not Mavenized or their artifacts are very old
in publicly available repositories.

Original locations of these projects (or at least source code I found):

1. http://www.trustice.com/java/jnireg/index.shtml
2. http://www.cloudhopper.com/opensource/rxtx/

You need to install the mock artifacts inside this directory to be able
to recompile and further develop the MtsCheckAccount.
